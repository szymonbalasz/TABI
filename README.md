# TEST-Company Business and Analytics Website

This ia demo I made for a local company. It automates one of their workflows - a performance register which compares how their employees performed during the course of a month.

It tracks interval as well as ordinal data in the form of actual work outputs as well as supervisor evaluations.

The demo was received well and enabled me to begin discussions with the company director to develop a more sophisticated solution for the business.

### The project is a full-stack Django application, using a PostgreSQL DB.
